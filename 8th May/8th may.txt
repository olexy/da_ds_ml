1. Load the data
2. Explore the data
3. Feature Selection (Totally based on business understanding)
4. Feature Selection (Statistical understanding)
	a. Remove columns having variance = 0
	b. Remove columns having too many null values/ outliers
	c. Remove columns which are highly collinear with the other features
5. Feature Generation
	a. Address - > New York, 12345
		Split this as name | pincode (two separate columns)
	b. Add dummy column
6. Separate the numeric and categorical variables
7. Split into train and test data
8. On the numeric you fit your PCA on train data and get the dimensions reduced
		Reduced numeric columns + categorical variables
	On test data transform your dimensions using PCA saved earlier
9. Scaling and Encoding is done
	On the numeric train data we learn(fit) & apply(transform) scaling and 		save the scalers
	On the categorical train data learn(fit) & apply(transform) encoding 		and save the encoders

	On the test data
		Transform using saved scalers and encoders
10. Fit your model
11. Predict
12. Evaluate	


Recommender Algorithms
_________________________

1. Content based 
   ______________
	
	Recommends items corresponding to the user's profile
	This profile is created by the purchase history of the user

	The profile is matched with the features of an item. And the relevance
	score is calculated. This relevance score helps me to rank the items
	accordingly

	This approach does not require to know who are the user's friends,
	community, a long history

	For a book, the features can be genre, author, publisher and year.
	A user shows an interest in some book.

	I will evaluate the features for the user against his interest


	Advantages :
	
	1. they will recommend items to the users according to what they have
	   liked in the past.
	2. They take user's profile into account for this; creation of this
	   profile is an easy job
	3. data related to other users are not required
	4. No Cold Start Problem - A New user (Age, Gender .....)
			 	I can start recommending items based on user's
				profile
	5. New items or unpopular items can also be recommended 

	Disadvantages:
	
	1. Every item requires a feature representation
	2. Users who have already seen a large number of items are difficult to 
	   deal with
	3. No user history for a new user
	4. User profiles are difficult to create
	5. User needs to provide feedback of the items he has appreciated. 


Collaborative Approach
______________________

	The recommendations are based on calculating similarities between the
	preferences of different users. 

	User 1  Item A _______________________
	User 2  Item A Item B
	User 3  Item C

	I have to collect the opinions of a large number of users. 


	If a user has purchased a mobile; then he will be recommended
	mobile cover, charger etc
	I can recommend him some games to be played

	Approaches:

	Item-Item similarity, based on sim between items(millions of 	users,items)
	User-User approach, based on sim between users (millions of users)

	
	User/Course    Python    ML    AWS    Devops

	John                     4              0

	Jack              2      3              1

	Marie             4              5      0
	

	Advantages :
	
	1. USe of other users scores are highly effective
	2. the more the no of users the more the scores and the better the 		quality
	
	Disadvantages :

	1. What if you have a low density USer * item matrix ?
	2. Cold start problem


	
	Knowledge systems
	__________________

		Knowledge explicitly obtained by combining items, preferences 
	and recommendation criteria)


	Similarity measures
	____________________

	1. Cosine Similarity

		i1.i2/|i1||i2|

		If two users are highly similar then cos 0 = 1
		If they are totally differnet then cos 90 = 0

	  In item-item sim we use this measure

	2. Pearson correlation
		
		sim(i1,i2) = cossim(i1-i1^, i2-i2^)

	  Mostly used for user- user similarity
