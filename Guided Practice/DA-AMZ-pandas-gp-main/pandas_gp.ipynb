    "There are specific instructions for completing each of these tasks below. You and a partner will be given ten minutes in a breakout room to work through each task. We recommend you both work on the same notebook by having one person share their screen. This also allows the person who is not screen sharing to do the searching on Google when necessary. After ten minutes we will get back together and work through the task as a group."
