Types

1. Score Estimation Method

	a. Heuristics - Design rules to identify the utility function and 
			validate it empirically. 
	b. Model - Use a ML model(statistical, probabilistic) to learn the 
			predictions of score

2. By Data Exploitation

	Content based method - You bought a mobile phone.
				I will search for similar items to mobile
				mobile cover, guard, earphone, wireless 
				charger....

				Use the item - item similarity and then
				suggest you the items which are highly similar.

	Collaborative Method - Lets say you bought a mobile phone
				I have 3 more users in my DB. User1, User2 and 				User3
				Find similar users to you using purchase 
				history. Lets say you are having a similar
				purchase behaviour to user2. So I will look 
				for what did user2 buy along with the phone.
				The user2 bought an earphone. Hence I will
				suggest you to buy earphone.

	Lets say you bought a cooler. 
			 Similar items to cooler are AC, Refrigerator etc
	But if I know that your friend who also bought a cooler had purchased
			a motor to run the cooler from company ABC
			Then I can recommend you to purchase the same
			motor ABC for your cooler. Why????
				
	Hybrid Approach - Both the content and collaborative

	
User Profiles :

	Explicit Data Collection : 
		User providing his opinion, choose the relevant item or add to 
		cart

	Implicit Data Collection :
		User visiting an item already seen, keep track of browsing 
		history, analyze the user's social network


Concepts required for the next class

1. Pearson Correlation
2. Cosine Similarity
3. Association Rule mining Slide 23 - 37 in lesson 9

Agenda

1. Collaborative Fitering
2. Association Rule mining
3. Text Mining	




1. Take the train data
2. Explore it and Transform it
3. Split the train data into 2
	train and validation
4. Fit your model on train and evaluate on validation
5. Once evaluation is done then use the model to predict on test data
	provided.
