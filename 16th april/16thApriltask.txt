1. Go through the Logistic Regression code and evaluation metrics. 

2. Upload the Titanic data

3. Read the data, Explore the data, Clean and process the data for modelling. 

The dataset is in Lesson 4 by the name "train.csv"

4. Build the model replacing the mean of the AGE column and see the evaluation metrics

5. Re build the model by replacing the mean with the groupby of Pclass and observe the metrics

6. Include the two columns left out i.e. "SibSp" and "Parch" and see if this changes the metrics

7. Go through the two links for standard scaler and min max scaler on sklearn documentation

8. Go through the Feature Engineering notebook before tomorrow's session
