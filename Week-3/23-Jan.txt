======================
4 Mathematical Pre-req for Data Science
1. Prob & stats
2. Linear Algebra
3. Matrix Calculus (multivariate Calculus )
4. Convex Optimization

==================
In Numpy, we can have 
A) normal 1D arrays >>>> shape = (n,)  for a numpy array having n elements

B) Special 1D array (viasually)... backend these are actually 2D
	- Column vectors .... where all the elements are present in a single col. .... shape >> (n,1)
	- Row vectors .... where all the elements are present in a single row...... shape >> (1, n)

C) Matrices (regular 2D arrays).... shape will be >>> (m,n)
D) Multi-dim matrices (3 or more dimensions).... shape will be (p,m,n) ... and so on....

==================

I want to fit a straight line thru these 3 data points.
y^ = m*x + c*;     m = slope of the line;     c = intercept of the line

ObJ: To find the equation of the best-fit line.
Claim: The best-fit line will have min value of the ERROR_Function (loss function/cost function)
(the best-fit line will have the "optimal" values of the slope & intercept)

error = y^ - Y
where y^ is the predicted values ofrom the model

We'll use the Mean Squared Error as the error function...
MSE = (1/N)*(Sum of squares of the errors)
N = no. of data points

How will i get the optimal values of the slope and intercept ????
(How will I minimize the ERROR_Fun ???)

I am looking for getting the LEAST value of the Squres of ERROR terms !!!!  >>>>>>> OLS..
OLS is a technique to get the minimum value of the ERrOR_fun (MSE in this case).
W = (X'X)-1 X'y
