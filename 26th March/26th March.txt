Session Flow : 

First few(10, 15) is registered for asking queries from previous session. 
Agenda : 
	1. Explain you the intuition behind the task
	2. The mathematics, if possible
	3. Other details
	4. Walkthrough a solved exercise(use case)
	5. In-class assignment

7....9 30 polling activity break : 20 minutes	

Last 30 minutes I reserve for discussion.

Ground Rules :

1. Use the chatbox only after complete delivery of the topic
2. In case of any issues in practicals, take a screenshot of the error and
	upload it in community forum with a small writeup of the issue
3. Share you the agenda, and you have to be prepared with the terms used in the topic to be covered.

Machine Learning
________________

	Traditional Programming
	________________________
	
		Adding two numbers

		Take number as input
		1. a = 4
		2. b = 3
		
		Write the logic
		
		sum = a + b

		Return the output
		
		return sum


		Inputs + Logic ------> Output

	
	Machine Learning
	__________________

		1. Input = 3,2 | Output = 1
		2. Input = 1,1 | Output = 0
		3. Input = 0,3 | Output = -3
		.
		.
		.
		.

		Input + Output ------> Logic/Pattern
		Output = Input(1) - Input(2)

		Example:

		Redness | Roundness | Price | Fruit

		   3.4       5          4     Orange
		   7.5       2.3	12    Apple
			.
			.
			.
			.
			.
			.
		Given Redness = 5.5
		      Roundness = 7.8
		      Price = 8

		     Fruit - Apple
